Our intent is to make it easy to use all "library" pieces of the code, in
both free and proprietary software.  Hence most code that we expect to be
linked into a client application is covered by an MIT-style license:

----------------------------------------

--------------------------------

A few files in the ao_sysdeps directory were inherited in part from the
Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector, and are covered by
its license, which is similar in spirit:

Copyright (c) ...

THIS MATERIAL IS PROVIDED AS IS, WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED.  ANY USE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Permission is hereby granted to use or copy this program
for any purpose,  provided the above notices are retained on all copies.
Permission to modify the code and to distribute modified code is granted,
provided the above notices are retained, and a notice that the code was
modified is included with the above copyright notice.

----------------------------------

A few files are covered by the GNU General Public License.  (See file
"COPYING".) Currently this applies only to test code and sample applications.
This should have no effect on linking "library" routines into proprietary
applications.

In the future, legal considerations may make it desirable to also cover some
newly added library routines under the GPL.  If so, these will be clearly
separated, and not implicitly linked into existing libraries.
