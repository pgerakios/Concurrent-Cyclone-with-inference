HOWTO:

  - Rebuild ORIGINAL compiler and tools

	./reboot.sh
	mkdir build/boot

  - Rebuild MODIFIED compiler

	./mkall.sh ---> build/boot must exist

 - Make a specified file
	./mkfile.sh src file  --> ommit file extension


TROUBLESHOOTING:

(1)  Cannot stat bin/genfiles/nogc.a

  rm bin/genfiles/nogc.a
  make clean build_clean all

(2) ./mkfile.sh src ioeffect
    needs build/boot to be present

(3) ./mkall.sh 
    needs build/boot to be present
    Run this if build/boot does not exists/deleted
